**Description**


Automated File Delivery and Server Health Check Solution is a tool designed to streamline and automate the process of retrieving files from a server and emailing them directly to end users. It also includes features for checking the health of pods and their versions, and tracking certificate expiration dates for application servers. This eliminates the previously manual, multi-step process of logging into a server, downloading the file to a virtual desktop, transferring it to your local system, attaching it to an email, and manually checking server health and certificate expiration.

**Features**


User-friendly interface: Simply provide the file name as input.
Automated file retrieval: The tool fetches the file from the server automatically.
Direct Email feature: Sends the retrieved file directly to the end user via email.
Pod Health Check: Checks the health and version of pods without needing to manually access OpenShift.
Certificate Expiration Tracking: Tracks and displays the expiration dates of certificates for all application servers to prevent missed renewals.

**Usage**


Navigate to the tool's page.
Enter the name of the file you wish to send.
Click 'Send' to automatically retrieve the file from the server and email it to the specified user.
Use the 'Pod Health Check' feature to check the health and version of pods.
Use the 'Certificate Expiration Tracking' feature to view upcoming certificate expiration dates.
